        Miranda recommends including words like “built,” “produced,” or “managed” to demonstrate leadership and independence. If you can describe a time when you were the “first” person to make something new happen at work, this will also help you stand out as an innovative and dedicated employee.

If you’re feeling stuck and aren’t sure of your strengths, Miranda recommends asking someone you trust for help. “If you’re having a hard time coming up with words to describe your best employable self, ask friends, peers, or coworkers how they would describe you,” Miranda adds. “Then work that into your CV.”Beyond this, Miranda says to avoid terms that could take away credibility from your application. “Don’t include words like ‘junior’ that show your weaknesses,” Miranda says, adding that doing so could serve to downplay your qualification for the role. “Instead of saying you’re the lowest on the totem pole, show how you ‘contributed,’ ‘supported,’ or ‘served’ in the best interests of an employer.”
